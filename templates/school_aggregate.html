                        <p>Below is inventory data about the reading and math programs at {{ school.name.title }}. Materials shown are those deemed to likely to be necessary for students in a classroom.</p>
                        <p>A curriculum is shown for a grade if there is some evidence of the curriculum being present at the school, either in the common materials (shown), or other materials that you can see in the full inventory. Some records have "No records" as the quantity, meaning that while the material is common for the curriculum, it is not recorded at all in the school's inventory.</p>
                        <p>PSSA test scores will be displayed for grades 3-5, 6-8, and 11. The inventory data was collected from the Philadelphia School District's inventory system, the number of students from their enrollment records.</p>

                        <p>By changing the "Needed Materials" column, you'll update this cost/number of missing materials, for example, if you believe that it is not necessary to have one material per student for a given curriculum.</p>                      
                        <p>When you change the number of needed materials from the default, you'll see that the number of materials needed for that curriculum changes, as does the price to close the gap (based on current negotated prices for each material).</p>
