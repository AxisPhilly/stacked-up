          <p class="intro">Most people would be surprised at the idea that a public school wouldn't have enough books. In Philadelphia, however, students and parents regularly complain of textbook shortages.</p>
          <p>As Philly schools prepare to open in fall of 2013 with limited staff and severely restricted budgets, this chronic issue is bound to surface again. This time, we're opening up the District's (admittedly flawed) records to ask: Do public school children have all of the materials they require to succeed academically?</p>
          <p><strong>Stacked Up</strong> is a tool that parents and concerned citizens can use to <a href="{% url schools_list %}">check the book records at neighborhood schools</a> and make sure that each school has all of its required instructional materials before school resumes in the fall.</p>
