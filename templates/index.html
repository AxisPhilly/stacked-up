This time, we have the ability to be proactive and answer the question: do public school children have all of the materials they require to succeed academically?</p>
          <p><a href="/schools">Stacked Up</a> is a tool that parents and concerned citizens can use to <a href="/schools">peek inside the book closets at neighborhood schools</a> and make sure that each school has all of its required instructional materials before school resumes in the Fall.</p>
